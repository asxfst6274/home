              <p class="services-details__text-1">
                Visitor Information - Visitor Information refers to personally
                identifiable information about a consumer, customer or former
                customer of the <%= dataFile.name %>.

                Internet Protocol (IP) Address - an IP address is a unique
                address that devices use in order to identify and communicate
                with each other on a computer network. An IP address can be
                thought of as a street address or a phone number for a computer
                or other network device on the Internet. Just as each street
                address and phone number uniquely identifies a building or
                telephone, an IP address can uniquely identify a specific
                computer or other network device on a network. We may use IP
                addresses to monitor login activity and for identification
                purposes when necessary for security investigations.
              </p>
              <p class="services-details__text-1">
                Cookie - a Cookie is a very small data file that is transferred
                to your device so that it can be identified later. Cookies are a
                basic way for a server to identify the device you happen to be
                using at the time. Cookies are used for many things from
                personalizing start up pages to facilitating online purchases.
                Cookies help sites recognize return visitors and they perform a
                variety of important functions. We may also use cookies to
                enable certain features of our website and to preserve your
                preferences and customize your experience when you visit and

              BEWARE OF PHISHING ATTEMPTS AND INTERNET SCAMS
            </h3>
            <p>
              While email is convenient and has a good business use, it can also
              be misused by criminals for scams and various other fraudulent
              purposes. “Phishing emails” are frequently used by criminals to
              entice the recipient to visit a fraudulent website where they try
              to convince the recipient to provide personal information, such as
              ATM card numbers, account numbers, Social Security numbers, access
              Ids and passcodes. Some of these fraudulent websites may also be
              virus laden and can be used to download mal-ware to your device.
              Fraudulent websites often look identical to a legitimate site, so
              it’s important to look very closely at the website address.
